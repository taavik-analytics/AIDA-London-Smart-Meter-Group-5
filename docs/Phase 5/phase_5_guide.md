## Phase 5 guide (Evaluation)

- Evaluate the obtained results
- Analyze the results of individual models
- Review process
- Decide the next phases of the project


Additional questions:

- How did machine/deep learning with different methods go?
- How well do different methods work?
- What do you see that needs further development in the models?
- How could you further optimize the machine/deep learning model?
- Other considerations about the task?

At this stage, the implemented models are evaluated more thoroughly and the stages of model creation are reviewed to verify the correctness of the model.
