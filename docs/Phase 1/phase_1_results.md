## Phase 1 (Business Understanding)

# Energy consumption forecasting 

## Business Objectives

The primary business objective is to leverage the London Smart Meter dataset to forecast energy consumption accurately. This forecasting can help in several key areas:
- **Energy supply optimization:** Ensure energy suppliers can optimize their production and distribution, reducing waste and lowering costs.
- **Pricing strategy**: Enable dynamic pricing strategies to reflect anticipated demand, possibly offering lower prices during off-peak hours to balance grid's load.

## Analysis of the current situation

The current situation involves fluctuating energy demands, ineffictive energy distribution and a lack of personalized recommendations for energy saving.

## Initial goals of data analysis and modeling

- **Understand consumption patterns**: Identify daily, weekly and seasonal patterns in energy usage across different household types. Also understand if weather has had an effect on the usage.
- **Predict peak demand times**: Forecast times of high energy demand to manage grid load effectively.
- **Identify energy saving opportunities**: Discover patterns indicating inefficient energy use to target saving recommendations.

## Project goals

- Develop a reliable model that forecasts energy consumption with a high degree of accuracy for the next 24 to 48 hours.
- Provide insights for the customer for better resource allocation, maintenance and policy formulations.
- Enable the creation of dynamic pricing models that reflect actual energy demand.

## Measurement of results

- Reduction in energy production costs due to recognizing demands.
- Improvement in customer satisfaction due to dynamic pricing and targeted marketing.
- Decreased carbon footprint due to optimized energy distribution and usage.

## Technologies used

- **Data analytics and machine learning frameworks**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (PyTorch?)
- **Data storage**: GitLab, Local machines
- **Visualization tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Personnel skills

- **Scientific skills** for data analysis, modeling and validation
- **Engineering skills** for building the infrastructure
- **Managing skills** for overseeing milestones, coordination and stakeholder communication
- **Business understanding** to translate results into business insights and recommendations.

## Work distribution

- **Date Engineers** focus on building the infrastructure, workflow and data pipelines.
- **Data Scientists** handle the analysis, modeling and validation
- **Business Analysts** and **Project Managers** coordinate between teams and stakeholders, ensuring alignment of objectives and business goals.
