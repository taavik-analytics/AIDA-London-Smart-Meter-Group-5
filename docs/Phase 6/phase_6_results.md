## Phase 6 (Deployment Plan)
### Plan and Implement Deployment 

The model can be deployed using a variety of methods depending on the use case. One common method is to wrap the model in a web service, which can be called via an API to make predictions. This service can be hosted on a cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. The model would be saved using a library like pickle in Python, and then loaded into the web service.

### Plan Monitoring 

Monitoring the model involves tracking its performance over time. This can be done by logging predictions and actual outcomes, then periodically calculating metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R^2 Score. Alerts can be set up to notify the team if the model’s performance drops below a certain threshold.

### Plan Maintenance 

Maintenance involves periodically retraining the model with fresh data to ensure it stays effective. This can be done manually, but it’s often more efficient to automate the process with a pipeline that collects new data, retrains the model, and deploys the updated version.

### Review Project 

The project review would involve evaluating the success of the project, discussing what went well and what could be improved, and planning for future projects. This could involve stakeholders from different parts of the organization.

# Additional Questions

## How is the model implemented into production use?

As mentioned above, the model can be wrapped in a web service and deployed on a cloud platform. Users or other services can then make API calls to this service to get predictions.

## What production service platform will be used? 

This depends on the specific requirements and resources of the project. Common choices include AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.

## How to upload a model to a production server?

The model can be saved to a file using a library like pickle in Python, then this file can be transferred to the server (e.g., via SCP or FTP). The web service on the server would load the model from this file.

## How to upload new data to the production server? 

New data can be collected through the application’s user interface, or it can be pulled from a database or data API. The data would then be preprocessed in the same way as the training data before being used for predictions.

## What kind of user interface will the application be?

This depends on the use case. It could be a web application, a mobile app, a command-line tool, or even a voice or chat interface.

## Wonder who will use the model? 

The model could be used by a variety of users, depending on the application. This could include business analysts, data scientists, or end-users of an application.
