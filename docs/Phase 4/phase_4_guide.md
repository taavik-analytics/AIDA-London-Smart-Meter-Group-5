## Phase 4 guide (Modeling)

- Choosing modeling techniques
- Build the model
- Evaluate the results
- Set appropriate error metrics
- Test the model and produce a test design plan
- Visualize the results


Additional guidelines:

- Choose whether to use a classification model or a regression model.
- Select the class variable or class variables, if the classification model is used.
- Select the applicable machine learning and deep learning models.
- Use 2-3 different machine learning or deep learning methods to solve the same problem if possible.
- You can compare several alternative methods and finally consider only the selected methods.
. Test different hyperparameter values ​​(also document the results of the experiments).

The results of the modeling will be evaluated in the next step.
